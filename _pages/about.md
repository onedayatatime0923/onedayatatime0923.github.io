Welcome to my academic homepage! I am a Ph.D. student in the **Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS)** at the **University of California, Berkeley**, advised by **Prof. Pierluigi Nuzzo**.  
My research focuses on the intersection of **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)**, **formal verification**, and **machine learning**, with an emphasis on ensuring safety and reliability in learning-enabled autonomous systems.

My current work investigates:
- **Assume–Guarantee Contract Frameworks** for scalable CPS design  
- **Verification of Neural Network Controllers** using formal and optimization-based methods  
- **Compositional reasoning** for decentralized and distributed systems  
- Applications to robotics, autonomous aerial vehicles, and intelligent infrastructures

You can find details about my recent publications, teaching experience, and ongoing projects through the navigation links above.
