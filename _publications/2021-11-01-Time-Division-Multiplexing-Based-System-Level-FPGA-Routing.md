This work presents a **system-level FPGA routing framework** based on **time-division multiplexing (TDM)**, enabling efficient sharing of interconnect resources across multiple functional modules.  
By formulating routing as a **resource scheduling problem**, the proposed method reduces hardware congestion and improves overall FPGA utilization without compromising timing constraints.

Key contributions:
* Introduces a TDM-based abstraction for global interconnect reuse.  
* Implements a scalable routing algorithm compatible with commercial FPGA toolchains.  
* Demonstrates reduced routing complexity and improved performance on large benchmark designs.
