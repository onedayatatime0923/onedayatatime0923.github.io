This work presents a **provably exact and cost-efficient framework** for converting **neural network controllers** into **decision tree controllers** that preserve the original system’s functional behavior.  
The proposed transformation enables interpretable, verifiable, and real-time-deployable control logic while maintaining accuracy and scalability.

Key contributions:
* Formulates neural-to-tree conversion as an **exact equivalence-preserving transformation** problem.  
* Introduces an **optimization-driven cost metric** to minimize the complexity of the resulting decision tree.  
* Provides **formal guarantees** of functional equivalence across all network activation patterns.  
* Demonstrates practical scalability on benchmark control systems, including **CartPole**, **MountainCar**, and **CarRacing**.
