This paper develops a **passivity-based analytical framework** for studying the stability and convergence of **hybrid learning rules** in large-scale population systems.  
By leveraging the concepts of **energy functions** and **incremental passivity**, the proposed tools enable systematic reasoning about emergent behaviors in **multi-agent learning dynamics** that combine continuous adaptation and discrete updates.

Highlights:
* Establishes generalized passivity conditions for hybrid population learning.  
* Characterizes convergence to equilibrium under mixed continuous–discrete dynamics.  
* Provides scalable tools for verifying stability in distributed adaptive systems.
